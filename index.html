<p>These are projects that I worked in summer of 2025, inspired by my son <a href="https://vedadehhc.github.io">Dev Chheda</a>.</p>

<p>I had to re-learn a lot of the web development using Java Script, React etc.</p> 

</p>Also I had to learn and familiarize myself with GitHub and other web based collaborative tools.</p>

</p>This is what you do when you retire early - work on things you enjoy, at your pace - no pressure!</p>
